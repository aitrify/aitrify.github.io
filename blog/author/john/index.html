If your site doesn‚Äôt have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve.When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile.lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.",

Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.So begins Hallam Hawksworth‚Äôs The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It‚Äôs a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:I don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm boasting, but I do believe I‚Äôm one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I‚Äôd like to hear about it.Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children‚Äôs classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.",

AI will require retraining your entire organization                  ‚ÄúImplementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies will require retraining across an organization, not just technical teams,‚Äù says Ben Lorica. Here‚Äôs why.              2. It‚Äôs not killing jobs. (Yet.)                  A new ZipRecruiter report found that AI created three times as many jobs as it eliminated in 2018.              ¬†              3. Learnin‚Äô good all this AI stuff for product management                  Marc Cramer takes a look at what product managers need to know about AI to be at peak effectiveness.+ Herding Cats: Product Management in the Machine Learning Era, tutorial at the AI Conference in San Jose              ¬†              4. What it really takes to scale AI                  Spoiler alert: Technology isn‚Äôt the biggest challenge. Changing company culture is the key.              ¬†              5. How AI can help predict toxic algal blooms                  It‚Äôs not the first AI designed to predict algal blooms, but by automating the identification of algae and the labeling when new algae are identified, this system scales easier.                  6. What AI can tell you about a low voice or Advil                  When people suffering from depression speak, the range and pitch of their voice tends to be lower. Someone who uses words like ‚Äúibuprofen‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdvil‚Äù is 14 times more likely to need emergency services than a person who uses ‚Äúsuicide.‚Äù Here‚Äôs how AI can save your life.              7. AI needs a new developer stack                  Krishna Gade, CEO of Fiddler Labs, looks at the gaps in systems and tools for AI developers.              ¬†              8.
